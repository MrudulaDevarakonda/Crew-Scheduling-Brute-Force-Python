# Crew-Scheduling-Brute-Force-Python
Optimization model for number of crews required to address the spill incidents as quickly as possible i.e., to minimize the repair time using minimization and maximin models on CT DEEP data
## Objectives: 
1. To analyze oil spills in cities **Naugatuck, Danbury, and Middletown** in the  state of Connecticut and with an aim to come up with an optimal solution for distributing **10** service crews among **3 different cities**
2. To understand the dataset and to come up with valuable insights from the same
